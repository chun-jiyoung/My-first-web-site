    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe <br>
      the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). <br>
      CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>

      CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. <br>
      Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, <br>
      which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. <br>
      There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.<br>
      After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, <br>
      that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, <br>
      W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress.<br>
      CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.<br>
