     is a markup language that tells web browsers<br>
    how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.<br>
    <p><u>HTML</u> consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap,<br>
    or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.<br>
    The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page,<br>
    italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
  </body>
</html>
